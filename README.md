Logistic regression credit risk model using the German Credit dataset
## Credit Risk Modeling – Logistic Regression

This project builds a baseline logistic regression model to estimate the probability
of default using the German Credit dataset.

The workflow includes data preparation, model estimation, coefficient interpretation,
and model evaluation using ROC/AUC.

The model achieves an AUC of approximately 0.62 and is intended as a transparent
baseline scorecard rather than a production lending model.
